<h1> Jefferson's Rough Draft of the Declaration of Independence </h1>
<h2> Finding the sources that he used </h2>

<p>
He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life and liberty in the <br>
 
 persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or <br>
 
 to incur miserable deathin their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobium of INFIDEL Powers, is the <br>
 
 warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has <br>
 
 prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce. <br>
 
 And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us,<br>
 
 and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them: thus paying off <br>
 
 former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES of another.
<br>
In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries. 
<br>
A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free. Future ages will scarcely believe that the hardiness of one man adventured, within the short compass of twelve years only, to lay a foundation so broad & so undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered & fixed in principles of freedom.
