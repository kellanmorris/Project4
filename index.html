<h1> Jefferson's Rough Draft of the Declaration of Independence </h1>
<h2> Finding the sources that he used </h2>

<p>
 HE has made ourjudges dependant on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, & the amount & paiment of their salaries. <br>

HE has erected a multitude of new offices by a self assumed powerand sent hither swarms of new officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
<br>
HE has kept among us in times of peace standing armies and ships of warwithout the consent of our legislatures.
<br>
HE has affected to render the military independent of, & superior to the civil power.
<br>
HE has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions & unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:
<br>
FOR quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
<br>
FOR protecting them by a mock-trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states
<br>
FOR cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:
<br>
FOR imposing taxes on us without our consent:
<br>
FOR depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury
<br>
FOR transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:
<br>
FOR abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging it's boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these states:
